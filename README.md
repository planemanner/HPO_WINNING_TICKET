# Introduction
  - This Repository is implementation of [Hyperparameter Optimization with Neural Network Pruning](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=ko&user=PywlW4gAAAAJ&citation_for_view=PywlW4gAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C)
  - This paper claims that any pruned neural network can produce a hyperparameter set which show similar performance with original neural network.
  - By using a pruned neural network, the HPO time decreases remarkably.
  - README update date : 2023 . 01. 29
# Requirements
  - pytorch  >= 1.6
  - torchvision >= 0.7.0
  - optuna >= 3.0.0
  - albumentations >= 1.2.0
# Usage
  - If you prepare TinyImageNet dataset in this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tiny-imagenet), just run main.py.
  - You can easily catch the role of args in main.py through the names.
    - However, I will update the explanation of each args in main.py soon
